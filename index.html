			<h2>We believe</h2>
			<p>
				We believe in death with dignity. We believe that the most valuable resource in hospice care is your attention. We believe the right tools can knit the care team together with <em>less</em> focus on technology, not more.
			</p>
			<p>
				We believe a less distracted and more meaningful point of care experience strengthens the entire hospice organization.

			<h2>We simplify</h2>
			<p>
				As we move into the 21st century, both the opportunities and challenges for end-of-life care continue to evolve. The requirements of federal compliance, the time-consuming nature of current electronic medical records, and the training and re-training of clinical staff can all take a toll on the mission to deliver thoughtful, focused end-of-life care.
			</p>
			<p>
				Much of the software we are forced to use directs our attention away from the faces we’re caring for and onto the screens that should be secondary. Records are kept at the expense of a hospice organization’s most valuable resource: the time and attention of its care team.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bloom was designed to simplify the point-of-care experience for everyone involved. Our absolute goal is to reduce the amount of time spent inputting information into software, using technology to actually increase your ability to touch your patients so you can truly stay in constant contact. 
			</p>
		</div>
	</article>
	<article id="we_improve">
		<div>
			<h2>We improve</h2>
			<p>
				Bloom complements, simplifies, and improves the EMR and administrative systems that you already use, regardless of vendor or solution.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bloom provides a single place on the tablet or mobile device of the patient, family and clinical staff to participate more meaningfully at the point of care. Video calls and text messages allow the patient, family, and care givers to stay in constant contact, all of which is automatically recorded and appended to the patient’s EMR.
			</p>
			<p>
				When communication is recorded, record keeping happens automatically and with higher fidelity, giving hospice staff more time for truly patient-centric care.

				Request a demo and learn how Bloom can create a better point of care experience for the nurses, patients and families in your hospice.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					See your patients’ face and situation clearly when they video call from their device, allowing better remote triaging, fewer false visits and 911 calls, and greater peace of mind for the entire family.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bedside instruction, tutorial videos, and print materials are available on the patient’s tablet, which can be remotely updated as the situation requires, continually customizing patient education to their individual care plan.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bloom’s patient and provider dashboard keeps everyone current and in constant contact. All relevant conversations are naturally organized and catalogued for easy reference, not lost in your inbox.
				</li>
